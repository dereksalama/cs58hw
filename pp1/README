Compilation: Make album
Usage: ./album image_1 [image_2 ...]

Once the program is running, you will have the option to rotate each thumbnail and add a caption. After the caption has been entered, the current image will be closed before opening the next. The output will be index.html.

Note on concurrency decisions:
My program blocks when creating original display thumbnail, since we must wait until it is ready before the image can be shown. The performance seems good enough that I cannot justify the additional complexity of, say, batch processing the thumbnails on launch. Otherwise, I rotate the thumbnail and create the medium image asynchronously, as there is no reason to make the user wait for those. When the program ends, I check to make sure all child processes are complete before prompting the user that index.html is ready.

Files:
album.c - contains main() function and all helper functions related to showing and processing images
input_prompt.c & h - contains a single function for prompting the user and copying input into a buffer
